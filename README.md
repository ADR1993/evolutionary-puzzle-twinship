## Files description

The repository contains two R scripts, a series of JPGs, and a shapefile of [world administrative boundaries](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/world-administrative-boundaries/information/).

maps_and_stats.R contains the code to generate Figure 1 in the manuscript, as well as the regression analysis included there.
To do so, it needs to import the files world_list_data.xlsx and twin_rate_data.csv, as well as all the JPGs and the spatial data files (shapefile). 
pregnancy_plot.R generates Figure 3, located in Box 3 of the manuscript.
