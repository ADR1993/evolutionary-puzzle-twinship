# The evolutionary puzzle of human twinship: data and code

This repository contains the data and code used to generate the plots and maps in the manuscript "The evolutionary puzzle of human twinship".
maps_and_stats.R contains the code to generate Figure 1 in the manuscript, as well as the regression analysis included there.
To do so, it needs to import the files world_list_data.xlsx and twin_rate_data.csv, as well as all the JPGs and the spatial data files (shapefile). 
pregnancy_plot.R generates Figure 3, located in Box 3 of the manuscript.
